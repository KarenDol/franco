Enormous spandrel expanses bearing the weight of some of the largest sheets of glass ever made were restored with a layer of concrete just 2 inches (50 mm) deep yet up to 70 feet (21 m) long. The precision of wood molds custom-crafted to each individual concrete rib’s dimensions was paired with the roughness of bush-hammering to achieve the interplay of form and texture that defines this Brutalist icon."}],["$","p","3",{"children":"Faithful reproduction of the original design—while addressing and fixing some of the problems inherent to that design—demanded a holistic approach to concrete restoration, from the creation of exterior light wells to the selection and application of interior surface-cleaning products.
